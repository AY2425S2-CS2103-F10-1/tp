ArtHive is a **desktop application for artists to manage clients and commissions**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ArtHive can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for ArtHive.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar arthive.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to ArtHive.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Examples:
*  Person A with phone number `81234567` has no tags. `untag p/81234567 t/project-x` makes no change and returns a successful untag message.
  *  Person B with phone number `91234567` has two tags `project-y` and `Project_z`. `untag p/91234567 t/project-y` removes the tag `project-y` only.
     ![untag](images/tagRemoved.png)


### Saving the data : `save`

Saves ArtHive data in the hard disk via passive (automatic) save or active (manual) save. Passive save activates after any command that changes the data. Active save activates when the user type in `save` as the command. This can be coupled with a [filename] parameter to change the name of the saved file. Upon changing the saved file name, all subsequent saves will be written to the new file.

Format: `save [filename]`

* Saves the data to the hard disk.

Examples:
* `save` proceeds to save the data to the filename pointed in `preferences.json`.

![save without parameter](images/save_no_param.png)

* `save newFile` proceeds to save the data to `newFile.json`, deletes old saved file, and updates `preferences.json`.

![save with parameter](images/save_with_param.png)

### Creating snapshot of data: `snapshot`

Creates snapshot of the existing data in the `snapshots` directory with a datetime stamp ("dMMMuuuu_HHmm").

Format: `snapshot`

Examples:

* `snapshot` proceeds to create a snapshot of the existing save file with the name represented with the current datetime (e.g., 24Mar2025_1721.json).

![snapshot](images/snapshot.png)

### Switching preferred contact : `switchContact`

Switch preferred contact. 

Format: `switchContact p/PHONE`

* If the current preferred contact method is email, it will switch to phone.
* If the current preferred contact method is phone, it will switch to email, provided the contact contains an email.
* phone is the default preferred contact method when a contact is created.
* If the contact does not have an email, the preferred contact method will remain as phone.

Examples:

* `switchContact p/91234567` Switches the preferred contact method for the contact with phone number 91234567.

![switch contact to email](images/switchContactJohn.png)


#### Editing the data file

ArtHive data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/[filename].json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:exclamation: **Note:**
[filename] refers to the saved file name that is specified in `preferences.json`
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ArtHive will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause ArtHive to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from ArtHive.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ArtHive home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

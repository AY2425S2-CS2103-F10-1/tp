* This is a contact management application targeted at freelance artists who prefer to keep track of their clients and project lists using CLI
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _ArtHive_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ArtHive Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103-f10-1.github.io/tp)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
